MapleStory Automatic 13-Stat Dice Roller

This Python program will use image-recognition to continuosly roll a dice until max stat (13 in our case) is rolled.

Very simple program keeping it as efficient as possible and not being too resource intensive, for a more advanced version - feel free to contact me.

I've also included code and images in case you are looking for a specific max stat, currently it will stop when any stat at 13 is detected.
